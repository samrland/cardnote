# CardNote
CardNote is a (currently very rough) note-taking app based on jeffalo's [written](https://github.com/jeffalo/written).

It is designed to be a very simple notes service that gives enough features for it to be useful, but just limits itself
enough to give a perfect minimal experience.

In CardNote, everything is run on your computer, so that you can rest assured that your notes are safe and secure.
We provide the interface, but everything is stored on your device, so nobody but you gets to see it.
